This might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. However, this score is limited as it's a second-order vulnerability and the vector starts with a stored input (votes[i]) that is likely stored in a database or a file.\n\nFIX:\n```\n$.get(\"challenge/8/votes/\", function (votes) {\n    var totalVotes = 0;\n    for (var i = 1; i \u003c= 5; i++) {\n        totalVotes = totalVotes + votes[i];\n    }\n    console.log(totalVotes);\n    for (var i = 1; i \u003c= 5; i++) {\n        var percent = votes[i] * 100 / totalVotes;\n        console.log(percent);\n        var progressBar = $('#progressBar' + i);\n        progressBar.width(Math.round(percent) * 2 + '%');\n\n        // Sanitize data before inserting into HTML context\n        var votes_sanitized = $(\"\u003cdiv\u003e\").text(votes[i]).html();\n        $(\"#nrOfVotes\" + i).html(votes_sanitized);\n        // method continues ...\n});\n```\nIn the fixed code, HTML entities within the user-controlled data are escaped before being inserted into the HTML context, thereby preventing potential XSS attacks."]}
