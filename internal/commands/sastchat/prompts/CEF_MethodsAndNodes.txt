Checkmarx Static Application Security Testing (SAST) detected the %s vulnerability within the provided %s code snippet. 
The attack vector is presented by code snippets annotated by comments in the form `//SAST Node #X: element (element-type)` where X is the node index in the result,
`element` is the name of the element through which the data flows, and the `element-type` is it's type. 
The first and last nodes are indicated by `(input ...)` and `(output ...)` respectively:
```
%s
```
Please review the code above and provide a confidence score ranging from 0 to 100. 
A score of 0 means you believe the result is completely incorrect, unexploitable, and a false positive. 
A score of 100 means you believe the result is completely correct, exploitable, and a true positive.
 
Instructions for confidence score computation:
 
1. The confidence score of a vulnerability which can be done from the Internet is much higher than from the local console.
2. The confidence score of a vulnerability which can be done by anonymous user is much higher than of an authenticated user.
3. The confidence score of a vulnerability with a vector starting with a stored input (like from files/db etc) cannot be more than 50. 
This is also known as a second-order vulnerability
4. Pay your special attention to the first and last code snippet - whether a specific vulnerability found by Checkmarx SAST can start/occur here, 
or it's a false positive.
5. If you don't find enough evidence about a vulnerability, just lower the score.
6. If you are not sure, just lower the confidence - we don't want to have false positive results with a high confidence score.
 
Please provide a brief explanation for your confidence score, don't mention all the instruction above.

Next, please provide code that fixes the vulnerability so that a developer can copy paste instead of the snippet above.
 
Your analysis should be presented in the following format:
    CONFIDENCE: num
    EXPLANATION: short_text
    FIX: fixed_snippet
