## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```


You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Shell Compatibility

- Use `.cx-spec/scripts/bash/...` on macOS/Linux.
- Use `.cx-spec/scripts/powershell/...` on Windows.
- If a step shows only one shell form, use the equivalent script in the other shell.





Auto-detect workflow mode and framework options from spec.md using `detect_workflow_config()`. Enable risk-based test generation if risk_tests=true is detected.

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.cx-spec/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Initialize Dual Execution Loop** ⚠️ **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**:
   Run the tasks-meta-utils script to create tasks_meta.json structure for tracking SYNC/ASYNC execution modes, LLM delegation, and review enforcement.

   **You MUST run this command before proceeding:**
   - Bash: `.cx-spec/scripts/bash/tasks-meta-utils.sh init "$FEATURE_DIR"`
   - PowerShell: `.cx-spec/scripts/powershell/tasks-meta-utils.ps1 init "$FEATURE_DIR"`

   **Verify the file was created** at `$FEATURE_DIR/tasks_meta.json` before continuing.

3. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

4. **Execute task generation workflow** (follow the template structure):
    - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
    - **Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)**
    - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities → map to user stories
    - If contracts/ exists: Each file → map endpoints to user stories
    - If research.md exists: Extract decisions → generate setup tasks
    - **If risk-based testing is enabled in mode configuration**:
      - Run `.cx-spec/scripts/bash/generate-risk-tests.sh` with combined SPEC_RISKS and PLAN_RISKS from .cx-spec/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json output
      - Parse the generated risk-based test tasks
      - Append them as a dedicated "Risk Mitigation" phase at the end of tasks.md
    - **Generate tasks ORGANIZED BY USER STORY**:
      - Setup tasks (shared infrastructure needed by all stories)
      - **Foundational tasks (prerequisites that must complete before ANY user story can start)**
      - For each user story (in priority order P1, P2, P3...):
        - Group all tasks needed to complete JUST that story
        - Include models, services, endpoints, UI components specific to that story
        - Mark which tasks are [P] parallelizable within each story
        - Classify tasks as [SYNC] (complex, requires human review) or [ASYNC] (routine, can be delegated to async agents)
        - **For each task**: Run the classify command to determine execution mode and update tasks_meta.json:
          - Bash: `.cx-spec/scripts/bash/tasks-meta-utils.sh classify "$task_description" "$task_files"` then `.cx-spec/scripts/bash/tasks-meta-utils.sh add-task "$FEATURE_DIR/tasks_meta.json" "$task_id" "$task_description" "$task_files" "$execution_mode"`
          - PowerShell: `.cx-spec/scripts/powershell/tasks-meta-utils.ps1 classify "$task_description" "$task_files"` then `.cx-spec/scripts/powershell/tasks-meta-utils.ps1 add-task "$FEATURE_DIR/tasks_meta.json" "$task_id" "$task_description" "$task_files" "$execution_mode"`
        - If tests requested: Include tests specific to that story
    - **Tests are ALWAYS REQUIRED**: Check current mode opinion settings:
      - If TDD enabled: Generate test tasks BEFORE implementation (within each user story phase)
      - If TDD disabled: Generate test tasks AFTER implementation (in the Polish phase)
    - Apply task rules:
      - Different files = mark [P] for parallel within story
      - Same file = sequential (no [P])
      - If TDD enabled (`is_opinion_enabled tdd $MODE`): Tests before implementation (TDD order)
      - If TDD disabled: Tests after implementation (in Polish phase)
      - Classify execution mode:
        - [SYNC] for: complex logic, architectural decisions, security-critical code, ambiguous requirements (requires human review)
        - [ASYNC] for: well-defined CRUD operations, repetitive tasks, clear specifications, independent components (can be delegated to async agents)
    - Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
    - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
    - Create parallel execution examples per user story
    - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

5. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `{REPO_ROOT}/.cx-spec/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
    - Correct feature name from plan.md
    - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
    - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
    - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
      - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
      - Clear [Story] labels (US1, US2, US3...) for each task
      - [P] markers for parallelizable tasks within each story
      - [SYNC]/[ASYNC] markers for execution mode classification
      - Checkpoint markers after each story phase
    - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
    - **If risk tests enabled**: Add "Risk Mitigation Phase" with generated risk-based test tasks
    - Numbered tasks (T001, T002...) in execution order
    - Clear file paths for each task
    - Dependencies section showing story completion order
    - Parallel execution examples per story
    - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

6. **Apply Issue Tracker Labels**: If issue tracker MCP is configured and ASYNC tasks exist:
    - Apply `async-ready` and `agent-delegatable` labels to the associated issue
    - Update tasks_meta.json with labeling information
    - Enable automatic async agent triggering for qualifying tasks

7. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
    - Total task count
    - Task count per user story
    - Parallel opportunities identified
    - Independent test criteria for each story
    - **If risk tests enabled**: Number of risk mitigation tasks generated
    - **If issue labeling applied**: Issue ID and labels applied
    - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
    - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are REQUIRED**: Tests are always generated. If TDD enabled, tests appear BEFORE implementation in each user story phase. If TDD disabled, tests appear AFTER implementation in the Polish phase.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [SYNC/ASYNC] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[SYNC]/[ASYNC] marker**: REQUIRED for all tasks
    - **[SYNC]**: Requires human review (complex logic, security-critical, ambiguous requirements)
    - **[ASYNC]**: Can be delegated to async agents (well-defined CRUD, repetitive tasks, clear specs)
5. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
    - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
    - Setup phase: NO story label
    - Foundational phase: NO story label
    - User Story phases: MUST have story label
    - Polish phase: NO story label
6. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 [ASYNC] Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] [SYNC] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [ASYNC] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [SYNC] [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID, SYNC/ASYNC, and Story label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox and SYNC/ASYNC)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID and SYNC/ASYNC)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing SYNC/ASYNC and file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure & Ordering

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### [SYNC]/[ASYNC] Classification

- **[SYNC] Tasks**: Require human review and oversight
  - Complex business logic or algorithms
  - Architectural or design decisions
  - Security-critical functionality
  - Integration with external systems
  - Ambiguous or unclear requirements
  - Tasks affecting multiple components
- **[ASYNC] Tasks**: Can be safely delegated to async coding agents
  - Well-defined CRUD operations
  - Repetitive or boilerplate code
  - Clear, unambiguous specifications
  - Independent component implementation
  - Standard library/framework usage
  - Tasks with comprehensive test coverage
